# Image Classification using Pre-Trained network
In this project, I trained an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. 
You can imagine using this in a phone app that tells the name of the flower or make, model and price of car your camera is looking at

I used 102 Category Flower dataset from http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html

**The project is broken down into following steps:**
- Load and preprocess the image dataset
- Train the image classifier on your dataset
- Use the trained classifier to predict image content

**train.py** uses this model to build a command line application which allows the user to build and train a neural network with different hyperparameters.

Hope you enjoy going through the project as much as I enjoyed working on it :)

If you have any doubts or suggestions please feel free to email me at st638@njit.edu. Keep learning. Thank you!
